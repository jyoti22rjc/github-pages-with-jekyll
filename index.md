We know programming languages are evolving with a rapid pace. 
So it becomes difficult to programming enthusiast to choose a language over other. 
C++,Python,Java,JavaScript,Go,Swift are the few general languages used for coding. 
Every language has its own feature like used for web development,scientific computing, machine learning,application development and for research purpose.
Like matlab a programming language is used for scientfic computing ,research,machine learning etc. 
Based on someone’s interest and application of that language one can choose the right programming language.
C,C++ are good start for knowing foundation of almost each language.Also C++ is rated best for competitive programming.
Java is a object-oriented programming language like C++ with additional libraries. 
Python is used in almost every field and it’s library is good enough to write a large program with few lines.
